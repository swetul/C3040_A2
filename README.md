# Create and Host a resume with GitHub
For this project you will need a few basic tools to successfully create and Host a resume on the internet. Some of the tools include Atom (a text editor), Jekyll and GitHub. Read more below to see how this can be done.

## Getting Started
The instructions below will help you with how the project can be successfully implemented. See Resume Tips for tips on how to make your resume attractive.

### Intended audience
Ideally, this README is to help people who would like to host their resume online but have limited or no experience in tools such as GitHub, Atom, Markdown and Jekyll. Below will be all the information you will need to successfully complete this project.

### Prerequisites
Here are a few things you will need to do before you start this project.
1. You will need a general understanding on how to write your resume using markdown, complete the following tutorial on how to [write using markdown](https://guides.GitHub.com/features/mastering-markdown/ "GitHub flavored markdown") or [learn the basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for markdown.
2. You will need to create a [GitHub account](https://GitHub.com/join?source=header-home "create an account") to host this project.
3. You can use the online GitHub editor to create your resume but I recommend you download [Atom](https://GitHub.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.41.0 "Atom download"), a text editor, see installation for how to install and notes.

#### Troubleshooting and tips

There can be a few places where you might find yourself stuck with a problem that you cannot find a solution to. Here are a few issues I faced myself and how to go about them.
* Issues with the links of your site. This would mainly occur if you have not selected the correct branch to Host in the settings, or your repository is private, for free Hosts the repository needs to be public.
* if you are facing issues with markdown, try looking at the prerequisites notes to find tutorials on how to write in markdown.
